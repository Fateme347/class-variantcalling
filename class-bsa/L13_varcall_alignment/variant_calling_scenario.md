### Hypothetical Patient Case: Little Timmy

**Patient:** Timothy "Timmy" Olsen, 7 years old.

**Presenting Complaint:** Timmy presents with progressive muscle weakness, delayed motor milestones, and multiple joint contractures.

**History of Presenting Complaint:** Timmy's parents first noticed subtle delays in his motor development around 18 months. He was late to sit unsupported and began walking at 20 months, but with an unsteady, wide-based gait. Over the past few years, his walking has become increasingly difficult, and he now tires easily. He frequently falls, particularly when attempting to run or navigate uneven surfaces. He has also developed noticeable stiffness in his ankles, elbows, and wrists, limiting his range of motion. His parents report that Timmy has difficulty getting up from the floor and struggles with tasks requiring fine motor skills, such as buttoning his shirt or using cutlery.

**Past Medical History:** Unremarkable. Timmy was born at term with no complications. He has received all routine childhood vaccinations.

**Family History:** The patient's father is healthy. The patient's mother reports a history of "stiff joints" and mild muscle cramping in her legs, but she attributes this to a previous sports injury. She has otherwise always been healthy. The patient has a healthy older sister. There is no known family history of neuromuscular disorders.

**Physical Examination:**

*   **General:** Alert and cooperative but appears fatigued.
*   **Neurological:** Normal cognitive function. Cranial nerves are intact. Muscle bulk appears reduced, particularly in the proximal muscles of the lower extremities.
*   **Musculoskeletal:**
    *   Muscle tone is generally decreased, but increased resistance is noted when attempting to passively extend the elbows, wrists, and ankles.
    *   Gower’s sign is positive (Timmy uses his hands to "walk" up his legs when rising from a sitting position).
    *   Joint contractures are present in the ankles (equinus deformity), elbows, and wrists. Limited range of motion is observed in these joints.
    *   Scoliosis is noted in the lumbar spine.
*   **Cardiopulmonary:** Clear to auscultation and percussion. Normal heart sounds.

**Investigations:**

*   **Creatine Kinase (CK):** Elevated (approximately 5 times the upper limit of normal).
*   **Electromyography (EMG):** Shows myopathic features with evidence of denervation and reinnervation in the affected muscles.
*   **Muscle Biopsy:** A biopsy of the quadriceps muscle reveals pathological changes consistent with a structural myopathy, including variation in fiber size, increased endomysial connective tissue, and some internalized nuclei. Immunostaining for certain extracellular matrix proteins reveals abnormal deposition patterns.

**Differential Diagnosis:**

Based on the clinical presentation, family history, and investigations, the differential diagnosis includes:

*   Duchenne muscular dystrophy (less likely due to the absence of male-to-male inheritance, but cannot be excluded).
*   Becker muscular dystrophy (less likely due to the absence of male-to-male inheritance, but cannot be excluded).
*   Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) – a group of genetically heterogeneous muscle disorders causing progressive weakness, particularly of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles.
*   Congenital muscular dystrophy – a group of muscular dystrophies with onset at birth or in early infancy.

**Clinical Impression:**

The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms and findings suggestive of a congenital muscular dystrophy, likely an atypical presentation. The elevated CK levels, myopathic EMG findings, and characteristic muscle biopsy results all point towards a primary muscle disorder. The presence of joint contractures and scoliosis further supports this diagnosis. The inheritance pattern suggests a possible autosomal recessive condition or a de novo mutation. Further genetic testing is warranted to identify the specific underlying cause and to provide accurate genetic counseling.
